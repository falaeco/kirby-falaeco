Throughout my audiovisual program at Cegep, I had the opportunity to create after effects compositions for some of the weekly television productions we had to do during our final year. Our introduction to post-production compositing and visual effects was very brief and I wanted to take the extra step and try some of the industry-standard programs in motion graphics. To make the following videos, I used Trapcode Form and Particular from RedGiant, a prominent post production software company. These short videos aroused my interest to learn more about motion graphic and I hope I will have the chance to create more intricate pieces in a near future.
